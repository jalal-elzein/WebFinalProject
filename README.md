# Mario Ultimate - Web Final Project

This is the final project for my web programming course with Dr. Gilbert Tekli.
You can run this website on a server with Apache/phpMyAdmin/MySQL. 

To run the database, create a database called "mario_db" with the username and password being "root" and "" respectively. Alternatively, you can change them in the db_functions.php file inside the connectToDB() function.

To instantly fill in the database with some dummy data, run the contents of the master.sql file.
